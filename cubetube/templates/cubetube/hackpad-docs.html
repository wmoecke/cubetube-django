    <h2 id="using-spark">Using the Spark App to Load Your WiFi Credentials on your Cube</h2>

    <p>
      <a name="spark-app">Download the Spark App to your phone from the </a><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-core/id760157884?mt=8">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.spark.core.android&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a> . (If you don’t have a phone that can download apps, no problem...you can still get your Cube online, it’s just a little more involved of a process to <a href="http://docs.spark.io/connect/#connecting-your-core-connect-over-usb">Connect over USB</a>)
    </p>
    <div>
      Once you’ve downloaded the Spark Core app from the App Store or Google Play, you should create an account. Afterwards, you’ll be asked  to connect your Core,
      <div class="offline-image spark">
        <img src="/static/images/docs/spark-code-addition.png" />
        <p>
          Spark App Login screen on iOS.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question-section wifi-question">
      <img src="/static/images/docs/wifi-symbol.png" />
      <p>
        Your phone must be connected to the  Wi-Fi network that you want to connect the Core to.  Wi-Fi Hotspots generated from the phone you are running this app on typically will yield an error claiming there is no Wi-Fi available.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, please try to <a href="http://docs.spark.io/connect/#connecting-your-core-connect-over-usb">Connect over USB</a> and enter your Hotspot credentials manually.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      When connected to Wi-Fi, the app will automatically fill the SSID  field with the name of the network that your phone is connected to.   Enter your Wi-Fi password and hit connect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This connection process can take up to a minute, so be patient. The closer your phone is to your Spark Core, the faster it will connect. Once the Core hears the signal, it will go through the following sequence of lights:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Solid blue: Credentials captured</li>
        <li>Flashing green: Connecting to Wi-Fi network</li>
        <li>Flashing cyan: Connecting to Spark Cloud</li>
        <li>Breathing cyan: Connected to Spark Cloud</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the Spark Core has connected, your phone will "claim" the Core and attach it to your account. Then you’ll get to name your Core.  If  you’re uncertain, you can confirm that the claim process was successful by logging into the <a href="https://www.spark.io/build">Spark Web IDE</a> and clicking the "Cores" icon at the bottom of the page.  Is your Core listed?  Great!  The world is perfect.
    </p>
    <div class="question-section">
      The Core MUST be online (breathing cyan)  in order for the claiming process to work. 
      If the Spark Core has been  claimed by someone else, the app won’t recognize it.  
    </div>
    <p>
      If you are connecting multiple Cores, you’ll go through this naming process for each Core. You’ll know which one is which by the rainbow signal.
    </p>

    <h2 id="claiming-core">Claiming your Core</h2>
    <p>
      Once your Cube’s Spark Core is connected to WiFi via the Spark App, it needs to be claimed in order to be associated with your account. This is what lets you control your Cube and keeps anyone else from doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use the mobile app to set up your Core, it should claim it automatically. However if you connect your Core over USB, or if the claiming process is unsuccessful, you can claim it manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      The easiest way to manually claim a Core over USB is to use the <a href="https://github.com/spark/spark-cli">Spark Command Line Interface</a>. Once you have this installed, you can simply type spark setup and follow the instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, if you have troubles installing the command line tool,  you can get the Core’s ID over serial and claim it via the build site. You can do this by opening a Serial connection to the Core and pressing  the i key (see the above instuctions for connecting over USB). It should show you a number like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i># Example Core ID55ff68064989495329092587</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then open up <a href="https://www.spark.io/build">Spark Build</a> and click the ’Cores’ icon. Click the button that says ’Add a Core’, and enter your ID in the text box.
    </p>

    <h2 id="wifi-locations">Switching to New WiFi Locations</h2>
    <p>
      When you move to a new WiFi locations, you can get your Cube’s Spark Core back into Listening Mode by clicking the big round "Connect to WiFi" button next to your Cube’s Spark Core, on the underside of the Cube.  This will not delete any programs you have stored in the internal memory of the Spark Core, and just clears the WiFi credentials and puts the Spark Core back into WiFi Listening Mode.  Then repeat the process above to connect to the new WiFi location.

    <h1 id="loading-apps">Loading Cubetube Apps</h1>
    <p>
      CubeTube is in beta and available to the earliest Cube owners.  Go to <a href="https://cubetube.org">CubeTube.org</a>  and log in your Cube using the same user name and password you used to create an account on Spark.io or via the Spark App when you first connected your Cube to WiFi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when you click "Load App" on one of the CubeTube Apps, that App should automatically load onto your Cube, as long as your Cube is connected to WiFi.

    <!-- Code for cubes -->
    <h1 id="code-for-cubes">Code for Cubes</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      There are two types of programs that can control Cubes.  One is Native code, which lives entirely in the internal memory of the Cubes. The second is Streaming code, which requires a computer to stream content to your cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      Native code does not require WiFi.  Streaming code requires WiFi, but is more powerful in the sense that you can connect peripherals to your computer to interact with your Cube (such as the Leap Motion, MakeyMakeys, Kinects...).  
    </p>
    <p>
      Streaming is required when controlling multiple cubes.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mode1">Mode 1: Native Code</h2>
    <p>
      To get Native code Apps onto your Cube, it’s a one step process.   Just log into CubeTube as described above and then click on any of the Native code apps and that app will download to your Cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      Native code is written in Wiring, which is the fancy name for the Arduino programming language.  You can write code on the <a href="https://www.spark.io/build">Spark Web IDE</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mode2">Mode 2: Streaming Code</h2>
    <p>
      To get Streaming code working on your Cube, it’s a two step process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Step 1:</b>
      Log into CubeTube as described above and then load the Listener App onto your Cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Step 2</b>
      Download the Streaming code from any of the Streaming Apps to your computer.  We’ve been running Streaming Apps in Processing, but folks are starting to write and stream python and Java Apps to their Cubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure your computer is connected to WiFi, and then any Streaming Apps running on your computer should play in your Cube (loaded with Listener as described in 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      If using Processing for your Streaming Apps, you’ll need to download the L3D Library.  More details here:  https://github.com/enjrolas/L3D-library
    </p>
    <p>
      Alex has also put together a guide on designing graphics for your Cube in 
      Streaming Mode here:  http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Draw-Sweet-3D-Graphics-for-LED-cubes/
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’d like faster streaming, try using a dedicated nano-router, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-WR702N-Wireless-Repeater-150Mpbs/dp/B007PTCFFW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419504623&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=travel+router">this one</a> for about $20.
